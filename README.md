# ROS_project

This is a project involving the use of ROS (Robot Operating System). This project was done using Ubuntu 20.04, ROS Noetic.
The goal is to control myAGV robot (four-wheeled robot) and do your own project.

Description of my project:
The robot is placed on the floor, and surrounding the robot is 4 different pictures. Lets assume we want the robot to find one of the picture. We run the code using ROS and the robot will first rotate. The camera attached to the robot will scan the surroundings and locate the picture. If the robots find the picture we wanted, it will stop rotating and go towards the picture.

The demonstration can be found in the presentation folder.
